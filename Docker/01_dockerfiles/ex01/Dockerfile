### Difference between tcp and udp
# There are two types of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic. They are TCP or
# Transmission Control Protocol and UDP or User Datagram Protocol. TCP is
# connection oriented â€“ once a connection is established, data can be sent
# bidirectional. UDP is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. Multiple
# messages are sent as packets in chunks using UDP.
#
# UDP is suitable for applications that need fast, efficient transmission,
# such as games. UDP's stateless nature is also useful for servers that answer
# small queries from huge numbers of clients.
